This was an assigment for the course in Visual Communication @ YRGO. The goal was for us as web developers to try on the role as designers and create a landing page for a chosen product. 

__The code includes:__
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

__The design and prototype was made in Figma.__

## Installation
1. To be able to see this webpage, clone this repository to your directory through the terminal.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/milliebase/avocado-landingpage.git
```

2. Change current directory to the cloned repo.
```
$ cd avocado-landingpage
```

3. Start your web server (8000 can be changed to any other 4 digits, ex. 1337 also works).
```
$ php -S localhost:8000
```
